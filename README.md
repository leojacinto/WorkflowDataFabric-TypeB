## Business motivation

Finance teams discover budget overruns weeks too late. Expense analysis requires manually piecing together data from ERP systems, data warehouses, and SharePoint. By the time finance reacts, small variances become major problems. **ServiceNow Workflow Data Fabric transforms reactive financial management into proactive intelligence**. By unifying data across systems through Zero Copy for SQL and ERP, Integration Hub, External Content Connectors, MCP, and AI agents, organizations can:

* **Detect budget issues in real-time** before they escalate
* **Scale financial operations** with AI agents, not headcount
* **Automate financial case creation** enriched with multiple external data sources and trend analysis

Your automations and AI Agents are just as good as your underlying data. Integrations powered by Workflow Data Fabric allow AI Agents to automate critical processes using accurate and consistent data.

With the trend of external agents reaching through enterprise data, it is worth examining why platform-native agents can scale more safely. Agents built within ServiceNow inherit battle-tested authorization models: role-based access, ACLs, and purpose-built security controls for AI agents; allowing organizations to automate confidently without stepping outside their governance boundaries.

## Persona context

You're a **Data Architect** serving the Finance department. Finance Managers need immediate visibility into budget performance. Cost Center Owners need to understand why they're over budget; with context beyond just numbers. **Your mission**: Build an intelligent financial data fabric that connects ServiceNow to external systems, deploys AI agents to detect and analyze budget issues automatically, surfaces executive guidance, and enables self-service analytics through Employee Center and Claude Desktop. You'll solve three critical problems:

1. "We find out about budget overruns too late: can we get real-time alerts?"
2. "Investigation means manually searching expenses, reports, and memos: can you unify this?"
3. "We answer the same questions daily: can employees self-serve?"

## Outcome

By completing this lab, you'll build an interconnected financial intelligence platform demonstrating:

* **Integration Hub** for real-time expense event processing
* **Zero Copy integration** with ERP and cloud warehouses (no data duplication)
* **MCP Server** enabling integration with any application that supports the protocol
* **AI agents** that autonomously search via [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation), analyze trends, and create contextual cases
* **Lens and Document Intelligence** for invoice data capture individually or batch, respectively
* **External Content Connector** bringing executive memos into making decisions
* **Finance Case Management** which receives the cases pre-processed by the AI Agents based on data taken from WDF

You'll master the architectural patterns for transforming siloed enterprise data into unified, intelligent decision-making platforms. **Let's build something intelligent**. 🚀💡

## Table of contents

This lab is divided into 5 exercises with the suggested sequence below. The ServiceNow-led lab environments which contains these exercises will allow you to complete individual labs in any sequence you prefer. The exercises focus on walk through and basic configuration of Workflow Data Fabric integrations and there are pre-made custom agents that make use of the integrations to demonstrate what is possible. You will not need to configure agents in this lab but steps are provided on how you can explore how the agents were configured.

This is designed to be a full day workshop covering most of WDF's capabilities. As such, we will not be able to cover in great depth all of the capabilities. If there are capabilities most relevant to your requirements, do ask your Lab Admin if there is a relevant deep dive lab available.

## A note from the author and some disclaimers

This lab involves integrating ServiceNow with external systems (e.g., databases, APIs, cloud services). Some steps require pre-configured environments and connectivity that may not be available in a standard PDI; this is best run as a guided workshop.
